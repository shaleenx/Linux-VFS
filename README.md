A Linux-like Virtual File System for storing files and directories in an hierarchical directory structure.

Particular focus has been on improvising the free space allocation 
in the virtual file system. 

Implementation Type: Best-fit Contiguous Memory Allocation

However, the code can be easily tweaked to implement other 
memory allocation techniques, as described in comments. 

The project has been undertaken with the intention of learning how 
files are managed on a Linux like system. The file system implemented 
also implements a Linux Shell-like interactive command like interface 
with functionalities like creating files and folders, deleting files 
and folders, viewing the contents of a file, summarize memory usage, 
and list all files and folders.
